Not at a glaud.

Delcot
This is the delcot of tondam, where <span class="creature">gitches</span> fly and duscats attack. Across from
a darken'd entryway, a path exists to northwest and west, enter-ing a <span class="object">samilen</span> to its
south.

Stick'd in the north exit are five glauds.

>t <span class="creature">gitches</span>
They exist in the <span class="vague">nest</span> and fly out to kill <span class="creature">warbs.</span>

>t entryway
It's the entryway of a <span class="object">morleon.</span>

>t path
You'll have to move at it before you can examine it.

>t <span class="object">samilen</span>
You'll have to move at it before you can examine it.
A group of <span class="creature">gitches</span> moves at the <span class="vague">nest.</span>

>t exit
Which do you mean, the west exit, the east exit, the north exit, the south exit,
the northwest exit, the southwest exit, the northeast exit or the southeast exit?

>north
You detect nothing useful about the north exit.
A <span class="creature">warb</span> exits the ground.

>t glauds
Which do you mean, the hold-able glaud, the alive glaud, the glaud-with-
lock-er, the glaud of <span class="object">jenth</span> or the Cobbic glaud?

>t hold-able
A hold-able glaud is about as useless as a <span class="vague">food</span> of <span class="object">jenth,</span> but at least it can
protect the doshery from the <span class="creature">gitches.</span>
A <span class="creature">gitch</span> flies from the <span class="vague">nest</span> to kill and eat the <span class="creature">warb.</span>

>t alive
It's weak, but it's still alive.

>t lock-er
You can't detect the hold-age, since the glaud-with-lock-er is close'd.
A <span class="creature">warb</span> exits the ground.

>t <span class="object">jenth</span>
The largest of the glauds, it exists near the north exit: six nayfes of <span class="object">jenth,</span> all
bad and hard.
A <span class="creature">gitch</span> flies from the <span class="vague">nest</span> to kill and eat the <span class="creature">warb.</span>

>t cobbic
A glaud with folls of the Cobbics is a awful thing. This one is strong-ly stick'd,
with a shell of poskot.
A <span class="creature">gitch</span> examines you from the <span class="vague">nest.</span>

>t shell
A glaud with folls of the Cobbics is a awful thing. This one is strong-ly stick'd,
with a shell of poskot.

>open lock-er
It seems to be lock'd.

>unlock lock-er
(with the <span class="object">shamtag)</span>
That doesn't seem to match the lock-er.

<span class="vague">>use</span> <span class="object">shamtag</span>
The <span class="object">shamtag</span> sounds!
The group of <span class="creature">gitches</span> are frighten'd by the sound-ing and move exist.
A group of <span class="creature">gitches</span> moves at the <span class="vague">nest.</span>

>t <span class="object">shamtag</span>
It's a good and sharmy <span class="object">shamtag</span> that sounds when you <span class="vague">use</span> it. Its top is
close'd. The <span class="object">shamtag</span> is currently set'd positive.

>set negative
What do you want to set negative?

<span class="object">>shamtag</span>
It opens itself, reveal-ing a pogrifon.
A <span class="creature">gitch</span> examines you from the <span class="vague">nest.</span>

>x pogrifon
That's not a verb I recognise.

>t pogrifon
It's a fancy pogrifon of sindish and koldgeon, create'd as a juffet for your
<span class="object">shamtag.</span>
A <span class="creature">warb</span> exits the ground.

>brighten self
Brighten'd.
A <span class="creature">gitch</span> flies from the <span class="vague">nest</span> to kill and eat the <span class="creature">warb.</span>

>j
Are you sure you want to move at the darken'd entryway? yes

<span class="object">Morleon</span>
This is the <span class="object">morleon</span> where the <span class="creature">drokes</span> <span class="guess">live</span> - or did, until it was darken'd.
The <span class="vague">canopy</span> and the exits are all of paided sindish. A <span class="object">fostin</span> is in the northeast
exit.
A duscat shudders west and east across the ground.

>t duscat
It's hardly large, but it could attack you still. It's beckling west and east and
whine-ing.
>whine
You whine. The duscat whines more <span class="guess">clear-ly</span> for a minute:
"duh kuh too... duh toh ker... ka te..."
Is there use or purpose in that?
The duscat whines.

>t <span class="object">fostin</span>
You'll have to move at it before you can examine it.

>move at <span class="object">fostin</span>

<span class="object">Fostin</span> of the <span class="object">Morleon</span>
The <span class="object">fostin</span> is far too fancy for the <span class="object">morleon,</span> but then, that's why it's a
<span class="object">fostin.</span> You can detect the <span class="object">morleon</span> from here.

You can detect here a unlock-er and a sign.

>t unlock-er
You detect nothing useful about the unlock-er.

>hold unlock-er
Hold'd.

>t sign
There's a message on the sign: "No <span class="vague">Charge-ing".</span>

<span class="vague">>charge</span> sign
You <span class="vague">charge</span> it until it's fully-charged, but it <span class="vague">discharges.</span>

>hold sign
Hold'd.

>r

<span class="object">Fostin</span> of the <span class="object">Morleon</span>
The <span class="object">fostin</span> is far too fancy for the <span class="object">morleon,</span> but then, that's why it's a
<span class="object">fostin.</span> You can detect the <span class="object">morleon</span> from here.

>k
You can't move at that exit.

>kh

<span class="object">Morleon</span>
This is the <span class="object">morleon</span> where the <span class="creature">drokes</span> <span class="guess">live</span> - or did, until it was darken'd.
The <span class="vague">canopy</span> and the exits are all of paided sindish. A <span class="object">fostin</span> is in the northeast
exit.
A duscat shudders west and east across the ground.

<span class="vague">>use</span> <span class="object">shamtag</span>
Since it's set'd negative, it doesn't sound.

>close <span class="object">shamtag</span>
You close the <span class="object">shamtag.</span>

>set <span class="object">shamtag</span> positive
You set the <span class="object">shamtag</span> positive.

<span class="vague">>use</span> <span class="object">shamtag</span>
The <span class="object">shamtag</span> sounds!
The duscat shudders and moves exist.

>k

Delcot
This is the delcot of tondam, where <span class="creature">gitches</span> fly and duscats attack. Across from
a darken'd entryway, a path exists to northwest and west, enter-ing a <span class="object">samilen</span> to its
south.

Stick'd in the north exit are five glauds.

>j
Are you sure you want to move at the darken'd entryway? yes
Please answer yes or no.> no
Ok, you don't move there.
A <span class="creature">warb</span> exits the ground.

>hold <span class="creature">warb</span>
Hold'd.

>t <span class="creature">warb</span>
A <span class="guess">common</span> <span class="creature">warb</span> of the ground.

>drop <span class="creature">warb</span>
It enters the ground.

>hold <span class="creature">gitch</span>
You hold one.

>t <span class="creature">gitch</span>
(the <span class="creature">gitch)</span>
Hold-ing it, you can detect its deeks. They're loddled, so it's a loddle-deeked
<span class="creature">gitch.</span> The rest of the group will be loddle-deeked too.
A loddle-deeked <span class="creature">gitch</span> examines you from the <span class="vague">nest.</span>

>drop <span class="creature">gitch</span>
(the <span class="creature">gitch)</span>
Drop'd, it flies <span class="vague">away.</span>
A group of loddle-deeked <span class="creature">gitches</span> moves at the <span class="vague">nest.</span>

>kl

Path
You're on a path exist-ing south, with gropples on the <span class="vague">canopy.</span> There's a barrier
across the path here, and the delcot is to east.
A pilter exists here, examine-ing the <span class="vague">canopy</span> for gropples to eat.

>t pilter
A massive <span class="vague">animal</span> with powerful tooths, examine-ing the northeast exit.

>t <span class="vague">canopy</span>
You detect nothing useful about the <span class="vague">canopy.</span>
The pilter moves at the south exit.

>t gropples
The path is cover'd with them.

>t barrier
The barrier exists across the path.

<span class="vague">>use</span> barrier
You <span class="vague">use</span> it. Nothing useful results.

>close barrier
You close it for a minute, but it just opens itself again. It must be bad.

>h

Path
You're on a path exist-ing north and west, with gropples on the <span class="vague">canopy.</span>
A pilter exists here, examine-ing the <span class="vague">canopy</span> for gropples to eat.

>k

Path
You're on a path exist-ing south and east, with gropples on the <span class="vague">canopy.</span> There's a
barrier across the path here.

>h

Path
You're on a path exist-ing north, with gropples on the <span class="vague">canopy.</span> To south is the
<span class="object">samilen</span> you detect'd from the delcot.

>h
As you enter the <span class="object">samilen,</span> a <span class="creature">droke</span> detects you. "A gostak!" he speaks. "Here to
brighten the <span class="creature">doshes?</span> You can't. A gamda create'd a <span class="creature">gheliper</span> in the delcot, and the
<span class="creature">gheliper's</span> been drop-ing glauds at the doshery. And as for us <span class="creature">drokes,</span> well, ever
since the gamda, our <span class="object">morleon</span> has been darken'd. But enter and speak! Maybe
you'll detect something useful."

<span class="object">Samilen</span>
A <span class="object">samilen</span> for the <span class="creature">drokes</span> of tondam. You can move at the delcot to northeast or the
path to north.
A <span class="creature">droke</span> is speak-ing at himself by the south exit.

You can also detect here a <span class="vague">food-creater.</span>

>t <span class="vague">food-creater</span>
It's a jeddy-paided <span class="vague">food-creater</span> with three selectors. The brimny selector is set'd
negative, the clarby selector is set'd positive, and the statched selector is set'd negative.
Its receptacle holds a tarshen <span class="vague">food.</span>

>eat tarshen
(first hold-ing the tarshen <span class="vague">food)</span>
You eat a tarshen <span class="vague">food.</span>

>set clarby negative
You set the clarby selector negative.

<span class="vague">>use</span> <span class="vague">food-creater</span>
It creates a suddy <span class="vague">food</span> and drops it into a receptacle.

>t suddy
It's not eat-able by gostaks, but you could drop it at a pank if you detect one.

>eat suddy
(first hold-ing the suddy <span class="vague">food)</span>
Ignore-ing the <span class="creature">droke's</span> speak, you eat a suddy <span class="vague">food.</span> But suddy <span class="vague">foods</span> are only
for pilters and panks, not <span class="guess">crazed</span> gostaks. Within a minute, you <span class="vague">dissolve</span> into the
ground.


*** You have been kill'd ***



In that game, there were are five glauds stick'd in the north exit of the
delcot.

>hold suddy
Hold'd.

>speak at <span class="creature">droke</span> about glauds
(the glauds)
"There's five glauds. Unless the <span class="creature">gheliper</span> create'd more."

>speak at <span class="creature">droke</span> about glaud
Which do you mean, the hold-able glaud, the alive glaud, the glaud-with-
lock-er, the glaud of <span class="object">jenth</span> or the Cobbic glaud?

>hold-able
"Hardly a glaud at all. Unless you're a duscat or a <span class="vague">animal</span> or something and can't
hold things."

>speak at <span class="creature">droke</span> about <span class="vague">animal</span>
"We're always detect-ing pilters on the path. They're almost as massive as panks,
but you can't create gropples without pilters."

>speak at <span class="creature">droke</span> about duscat
(the duscat)
"So that's what's been attack-ing <span class="creature">drokes</span> in the <span class="object">morleon.</span> It must have been frighten'd
from the delcot by the <span class="creature">gheliper."</span>

>speak at <span class="creature">droke</span> about duscats
"I can't speak anything at you about those."

>speak at <span class="creature">droke</span> about pilters

"Powerful tooths, those panks hold. They can bite sindish or peel the shell
off a lonn."

>speak at <span class="creature">droke</span> about lonn
"You won't detect any lonns in the delcot of tondam. The Cobbics hold them all."

>speak at <span class="creature">droke</span> about sindish
(sindish)
"The exits of the <span class="object">morleon</span> are of sindish."

"I can't speak anything at you about that."

>speak at <span class="creature">droke</span> about shell
(the shells in general)
"The Cobbics are fond of shells. That's why there are shells on some of the
<span class="vague">foods</span> here."

>speak at <span class="creature">droke</span> about <span class="vague">foods</span>
You haven't detect'd or been speak'd about any such thing.

Awful. Always the <span class="vague">foods</span> of <span class="object">jenth."</span>

>speak at <span class="creature">droke</span> about <span class="object">jenth</span> glaud
"Ah, <span class="object">jenth.</span> It can't be <span class="vague">use'd,</span> or kill'd, or open'd. But I once detect'd a pank
in a sitch of <span class="object">jenth.</span> The pank bite'd the <span class="object">jenth</span> with its tooths, and it just
drop'd from where it was stick'd."

>speak at <span class="creature">droke</span> about tooths
(the tooths)
"Most <span class="vague">animals</span> hold tooths, but few hold ones powerful enough to bite sindish or
<span class="object">jenth."</span>

>speak at <span class="creature">droke</span> about <span class="creature">gheliper</span>
"She was the largest <span class="creature">gheliper</span> I've ever detect'd, and bad, too. She just enter'd
the delcot, drop'd those glauds at the doshery, and move'd <span class="vague">away."</span>

>speak at <span class="creature">droke</span> about <span class="object">shamtag</span>
"Don't <span class="vague">use</span> that thing in the <span class="object">samilen."</span>

>speak at <span class="creature">droke</span> about pogrifon
"That's weak for a gostak's <span class="object">shamtag,</span> isn't it? They must be fond of you at the
bewl."

>speak at <span class="creature">droke</span> about <span class="creature">warb</span>
"That's for the <span class="creature">gitches.</span> Ever examine'd the dorl? <span class="creature">Gitches</span> don't exist there. No
<span class="creature">warbs,</span> that's why."

>speak at <span class="creature">droke</span> about <span class="creature">gitches</span>
"We're near of <span class="creature">gitches</span> here. The delcot is cover'd with them. Hence the
<span class="vague">nest."</span>

"I can't speak anything at you about that."

>speak at <span class="creature">droke</span> about deeks
"She was the largest <span class="creature">gheliper</span> I've ever detect'd, and bad, too. She just enter'd

"One of the other <span class="creature">drokes</span> drop'd a unlock-er in the <span class="object">fostin,</span> but we can't enter there
now. The whole <span class="object">morleon</span> was darken'd by the gamda that create'd the <span class="creature">gheliper.</span>

"But you're a gostak. Darken-age is nothing to you, eh?"

>speak at <span class="creature">droke</span> about unlock-er
"So, you hold'd it. Could you give it at me after you've unlock'd the
lock-er?"

>speak at <span class="creature">droke</span> about purpose
"I'm a <span class="creature">droke;</span> my purpose is speak-ing. But you're a gostak. Your purpose is darken-age
and brighten-ing. Brighten-ing the <span class="creature">doshes."</span>

>speak at <span class="creature">droke</span> about bewl
"That's where you gostaks move from, isn't it?"

>speak at <span class="creature">droke</span> about <span class="object">morleon</span>
(the <span class="object">Morleon)</span>
"It's darken'd, and everyone who's move'd at it has been attack'd."

>speak at <span class="creature">droke</span> about <span class="object">samilen</span>
"I've been in the <span class="object">samilen</span> ever since the <span class="object">morleon</span> was darken'd."

>speak at <span class="creature">droke</span> about gamda
"It could reenter. It could even create another <span class="creature">gheliper.</span> After all, there are no

"The Cobbics exist in the dorl and create the panks."

You haven't detect'd or been speak'd about any such thing.

>speak at <span class="creature">droke</span> about gropples

(the path)
"It's a jurmy exist, but not as jurmy as the <span class="object">morleon."</span>

>speak at <span class="creature">droke</span> about <span class="vague">canopy</span>
"I can't speak anything at you about that."

>speak at <span class="creature">droke</span> about doshery
"It's north of the delcot, but the <span class="creature">gheliper</span> create'd some glauds, and they're
protect-ing it. I can't speak why."

>speak at <span class="creature">droke</span> about barrier
"Before we create'd that barrier, the pilters would enter the delcot sometimes."

>speak at <span class="creature">droke</span> about sign
"A sign? A sign? Oh, the 'No <span class="vague">Charge-ing'</span> sign from the <span class="object">fostin.</span> Not useful. You
can <span class="vague">charge.</span> Not there's anything very <span class="vague">charge-able</span> left."

>sound
You sound weak-ly.
The <span class="creature">droke</span> examines you upset.

You whine.

To speak at someone, try "someone, ignore me" or some such.

<span class="creature">>droke,</span> ignore me
"No, I'll just exist here in case one of the other <span class="creature">drokes</span> reenters."

>speak at <span class="creature">droke</span> about brimny
"That's for koldgeon."

>speak at <span class="creature">droke</span> about clarby
"That's to create the <span class="vague">foods</span> nice. I always set that one positive for a nice tarshen
<span class="vague">food,</span> but if one of the other selectors is set'd, it creates it with a shell."

>speak at <span class="creature">droke</span> about statched
"That's for shebtak."

>speak at <span class="creature">droke</span> about koldgeon
(koldgeon)

You set the brimny selector positive.

<span class="vague">>use</span> create-er
It creates a footch <span class="vague">food</span> and drops it into a receptacle.

Good, very good. There's so much koldgeon in this <span class="vague">food,</span> you can't examine it for
more than a minute.

>speak at <span class="creature">droke</span> about whomm
"That's a <span class="vague">food</span> for a gostak, that is."
