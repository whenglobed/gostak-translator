<span class="object">Delcot</span>
This is the <span class="object">delcot</span> of <span class="object">tondam,</span> where <span class="creature">gitches</span> fly and <span class="creature">duscats</span> attack. Across from
a darken'd entryway, a path exists to northwest and west, enter-ing a <span class="object">samilen</span> to its
south.

Stick'd in the north exit are five <span class="vague">wards.<span class="tooltip">glauds</span></span>

>t <span class="creature">gitches</span>
They exist in the <span class="vague">nest<span class="tooltip">hoggam</span></span> and fly out to kill <span class="creature">warbs.</span>

>t entryway
It's the entryway of a <span class="object">morleon.</span>

>t path
You'll have to move at it before you can examine it.

>t <span class="object">samilen</span>
You'll have to move at it before you can examine it.
A group of <span class="creature">gitches</span> moves at the <span class="vague">nest.<span class="tooltip">hoggam</span></span>

>t exit
Which do you mean, the west exit, the east exit, the north exit, the south exit,
the northwest exit, the southwest exit, the northeast exit or the southeast exit?

>north
You detect nothing useful about the north exit.
A <span class="creature">warb</span> exits the ground.

>t <span class="vague">wards<span class="tooltip">glauds</span></span>
Which do you mean, the hold-able <span class="vague">ward,<span class="tooltip">glaud</span></span> the alive <span class="vague">ward,<span class="tooltip">glaud</span></span> the glaud-with-
lock-er, the <span class="vague">ward<span class="tooltip">glaud</span></span> of <span class="object">jenth</span> or the <span class="creature">Cobbic</span> <span class="vague">ward?<span class="tooltip">glaud</span></span>

>t hold-able
A hold-able <span class="vague">ward<span class="tooltip">glaud</span></span> is about as useless as a food of <span class="object">jenth,</span> but at least it can
protect the <span class="object">doshery</span> from the <span class="creature">gitches.</span>
A <span class="creature">gitch</span> flies from the <span class="vague">nest<span class="tooltip">hoggam</span></span> to kill and eat the <span class="creature">warb.</span>

>t alive
It's weak, but it's still alive.

>t lock-er
You can't detect the hold-age, since the <span class="vague">ward-with-lock-er<span class="tooltip">glaud-with-roggler</span></span> is close'd.
A <span class="creature">warb</span> exits the ground.

>t <span class="object">jenth</span>
The largest of the <span class="vague">wards,<span class="tooltip">glauds</span></span> it exists near the north exit: six <span class="vague">measures<span class="tooltip">nayfes</span></span> of <span class="object">jenth,</span> all
bad and hard.
A <span class="creature">gitch</span> flies from the <span class="vague">nest<span class="tooltip">hoggam</span></span> to kill and eat the <span class="creature">warb.</span>

>t <span class="creature">cobbic</span>
A <span class="vague">ward<span class="tooltip">glaud</span></span> with <span class="unknown">folls</span> of the <span class="creature">Cobbics</span> is a awful thing. This one is strong-ly stick'd,
with a shell of <span class="object">poskot.</span>
A <span class="creature">gitch</span> examines you from the <span class="vague">nest.<span class="tooltip">hoggam</span></span>

>t shell
A <span class="vague">ward<span class="tooltip">glaud</span></span> with <span class="unknown">folls</span> of the <span class="creature">Cobbics</span> is a awful thing. This one is strong-ly stick'd,
with a shell of <span class="object">poskot.</span>

>open lock-er
It seems to be lock'd.

>unlock lock-er
(with the <span class="object">shamtag)</span>
That doesn't seem to match the lock-er.

<span class="vague">>use<span class="tooltip">durch</span></span> <span class="object">shamtag</span>
The <span class="object">shamtag</span> sounds!
The group of <span class="creature">gitches</span> are frighten'd by the sound-ing and move exist.
A group of <span class="creature">gitches</span> moves at the <span class="vague">nest.<span class="tooltip">hoggam</span></span>

>t <span class="object">shamtag</span>
It's a good and <span class="guess">stylish<span class="tooltip">sharmy</span></span> <span class="object">shamtag</span> that sounds when you <span class="vague">use<span class="tooltip">durch</span></span> it. Its compartment is
close'd. The <span class="object">shamtag</span> is currently set'd positive.

>set negative
What do you want to set negative?

<span class="object">>shamtag</span>
It opens itself, reveal-ing a <span class="object">pogrifon.</span>
A <span class="creature">gitch</span> examines you from the <span class="vague">nest.<span class="tooltip">hoggam</span></span>

>x <span class="object">pogrifon</span>
That's not a verb I recognise.

>t <span class="object">pogrifon</span>
It's a <span class="guess">fancy<span class="tooltip">dobbly</span></span> <span class="object">pogrifon</span> of <span class="object">sindish</span> and <span class="object">koldgeon,</span> create'd as a <span class="object">juffet</span> for your
<span class="object">shamtag.</span>
A <span class="creature">warb</span> exits the ground.

>brighten self
Brighten'd.
A <span class="creature">gitch</span> flies from the <span class="vague">nest<span class="tooltip">hoggam</span></span> to kill and eat the <span class="creature">warb.</span>

<span class="object">Morleon</span>
This is the <span class="object">morleon</span> where the <span class="creature">drokes</span> <span class="guess">gather<span class="tooltip">contail</span></span> - or did, until it was darken'd.
The <span class="vague">canopy<span class="tooltip">fosk</span></span> and the exits are all of <span class="unknown">paided</span> <span class="object">sindish.</span> A <span class="object">fostin</span> is in the northeast
exit.
A <span class="creature">duscat</span> shudders west and east across the ground.

>t <span class="creature">duscat</span>
It's hardly large, but it could attack you still. It's beckling west and east and
whine-ing.
>whine
You whine. The <span class="creature">duscat</span> whines more <span class="guess">clear-ly<span class="tooltip">podly</span></span> for a minute:
"duh kuh too... duh toh ker... ka te..."
Is there use or purpose in that?
The <span class="creature">duscat</span> whines.

>t <span class="object">fostin</span>
You'll have to move at it before you can examine it.

>move at <span class="object">fostin</span>

<span class="object">Fostin</span> of the <span class="object">Morleon</span>
The <span class="object">fostin</span> is far too <span class="guess">fancy<span class="tooltip">dobbly</span></span> for the <span class="object">morleon,</span> but then, that's why it's a
<span class="object">fostin.</span> You can detect the <span class="object">morleon</span> from here.

You can detect here a unlock-er and a sign.

>t unlock-er
You detect nothing useful about the unlock-er.

>hold unlock-er
Hold'd.

<span class="object">samilen</span> you detect'd from the <span class="object">delcot.</span>

>h
As you enter the <span class="object">samilen,</span> a <span class="creature">droke</span> detects you. "A <span class="creature">gostak!"</span> he speaks. "Here to
brighten the <span class="creature">doshes?</span> You can't. A <span class="creature">gamda</span> create'd a <span class="creature">gheliper</span> in the <span class="object">delcot,</span> and the
<span class="creature">gheliper's</span> been drop-ing <span class="vague">wards<span class="tooltip">glauds</span></span> at the <span class="object">doshery.</span> And as for us <span class="creature">drokes,</span> well, ever
since the <span class="creature">gamda,</span> our <span class="object">morleon</span> has been darken'd. But enter and speak! Maybe
you'll detect something useful."

<span class="object">Samilen</span>
A <span class="object">samilen</span> for the <span class="creature">drokes</span> of <span class="object">tondam.</span> You can move at the <span class="object">delcot</span> to northeast or the
path to north.
A <span class="creature">droke</span> is speak-ing at himself by the south exit.

You can also detect here a food-creater.

>t food-creater
It's a jeddy-paided food-creater with three selectors. The <span class="unknown">brimny</span> selector is set'd
negative, the <span class="unknown">clarby</span> selector is set'd positive, and the <span class="unknown">statch'd</span> selector is set'd negative.

You eat a <span class="unknown">tarshen</span> food.

>set <span class="unknown">clarby</span> negative
You set the <span class="unknown">clarby</span> selector negative.

<span class="vague">>use<span class="tooltip">durch</span></span> food-creater
It creates a suddy food and drops it into a receptacle.

>t suddy
It's not eat-able by <span class="creature">gostaks,</span> but you could drop it at a <span class="creature">pank</span> if you detect one.

>eat suddy
(first hold-ing the suddy food)
Ignore-ing the <span class="creature">droke's</span> speak, you eat a suddy food. But suddy foods are only
for <span class="creature">pilter-ers</span> and <span class="creature">panks,</span> not <span class="guess">crazed<span class="tooltip">dunmile</span></span> <span class="creature">gostaks.</span> Within a minute, you <span class="vague">dissolve<span class="tooltip">smib</span></span> into the
ground.


*** You have been kill'd ***



In that game, there were are five <span class="vague">wards<span class="tooltip">glauds</span></span> stick'd in the north exit of the

Of course, the <span class="creature">gheliper</span> could always reenter. The <span class="creature">gamda,</span> even, could reenter. But
for now, the <span class="creature">doshes</span> are brighten'd. And that's enough for a <span class="creature">gostak.</span>
