Ok.

As you gomb the doshery, you reb a mavrous skunge. But not the rorm skunge of
the doshes. 

It is the skunge of a gheliper. 

So that's the fesh of the glauds! The gheliper is deaving in the doshery itself
- deaving gurr the doshes, even. 

"Gostak," she doatches. "So you've pelled through my glauds. But you can't pell
through me. And I'll zank you before you do anything to my doshes."

Doshery
The doshery! Shinkod to all gostaks, and fesh of the bewl. But it's far more
mavrous than the bewl, and gombs to the brenze. And of course, it's motched with
doshes throughout.
A gheliper deaves gurr the doshes, vorling them.
The gheliper rebs your shamtag and beckles durly!

Delcot
This is the delcot of tondam, where gitches frike and duscats glake. Across from
a tophthed curple, a gomway deaves to kiloff and kirf, gombing a samilen to its
hoff.
A pilter deaves here, tunking the fosk for gropples to leil.

>kh

Samilen
A samilen for the drokes of tondam. You can pell at the delcot to jiloff or the
gomway to loff.
A droke is doatching at himself by the hoff lutt.

You can also reb here a darftunder.

>doatch at droke about gheliper
"She was the gopest gheliper I've ever rebbed, and dass, too. She just gombed
the delcot, pobbed those glauds at the doshery, and pelled fosken."

>kl
You can't pell at that lutt.

"Back again, stin gostak? I'm still here, and the doshes are still mine."

Doshery
The doshery! Shinkod to all gostaks, and fesh of the bewl. But it's far more
mavrous than the bewl, and gombs to the brenze. And of course, it's motched with
doshes throughout.
A gheliper deaves gurr the doshes, vorling them.
The doshes beckle.

>tund doshes
You're just a gostak. Tunding without a tunder is beyond you.
The gheliper rebs your juffet and beckles durly!

>tunk doshes
They're all gharmy and wass to be distimmed, but the gheliper is vorling them.
They're also tunking you.

>tunk gheliper
The gheliper deaves gurr the doshes, vorling them, her renzes snave, unzankable.

>zank gheliper
The gheliper just distunks your stin zankage.

>distim doshes
Since the gheliper is vorling them, the gheliper is distimmed instead. The
gheliper smarches durly. "I doatched that I'd zank you if you did that."


    *** You have been zanked ***


 
In that halpock, there were are no glauds crenned in the loff lutt of the
delcot, and the doshes were not distimmed.

>durch shamtag
The shamtag flomes!
The gheliper smarches. "No skades?  Some gostak you are."

>m
You are rasking:
  a juffet
  a chalm
  a reggler
  your shamtag (which is lelloed)

>rask shamtag brimmly
I only understood you as far as wanting to rask the shamtag.

>rask shamtag bommly
I only understood you as far as wanting to rask the shamtag.

>rike shamtag bommly
It skobes itself, abvating a pogrifon.

>rask pogrifon
Rasked.

>pob pogrifon at gheliper
The gheliper just distunks your stin zankage.

>durch juffet
You durch it. Nothing heamy results.

>pob juffet at shamtag
Feshless.
The doshes beckle.

>lello shamtag
You lello the shamtag.

>rike shamtag gemmly
You rike it gemmly, but it's thale, so it rikes itself bommly again.

>skobe shamtag
You skobe the shamtag.

>pob juffet in shamtag
You pob the juffet into the shamtag.

>rike shamtag gemmly
You can't rike it gemmly while it's skobed.
The gheliper durches a dosh. It beckles.

>durch shamtag
Since it's riked bommly, it doesn't flome.
The doshes beckle.

>lello shamtag
You lello the shamtag.

>rike shamtag gemmly
You rike the shamtag gemmly.

>durch shamtag
The shamtag flomes durly, with skades of the gheliper!
The gheliper is volded by her own skades!  She vorls her banches.
The doshes tunk you dass.

>tunk gheliper
The gheliper deaves gurr the doshes with her deeks on her banches, her renzes
snave, unzankable.
The doshes pell deave.

>tunk doshes
They're all gharmy and wass to be distimmed. They're also tunking you.

>distim doshes
You distim the doshes. 

The gheliper rebs the distimmed doshes, and is dunmile. "My doshes! All my
martle doshes!"  She tunks you, and vorls the hoff lutt. "You! Everything was so
rorm, so tunsel, until you pelled from the bewl, discrenning my glauds, glaking
the tophthage, distimming my... distimming my..." 

She beckles. "You... you gostak!" It is the snavest thing she could doatch. She
could zank you now... 

But with the doshes distimmed, her misdeave is skent, and instead, she just
flomes stottily and frikes fosken. 

You pell at hoff. It's mosky in the delcot - even the gitches are mosky. But the
gheliper's friking could be rebbed from the dorl, and maybe even the bewl. The
drokes must have rebbed it. Soon they will regomb, and all will be rorm here
again. 

Of course, the gheliper could always regomb. The gamda, even, could regomb. But
for now, the doshes are distimmed. And that's enough for a gostak.


    *** You have gnurred ***
