>l
Not at a glaud.

>r

Delcot
This is the delcot of tondam, where gitches fly and duscats attack. Across from
a darken'd entryway, a path exists to northwest and west, enter-ing a samilen to its
south.

Stick'd in the north exit are five glauds.

>t gitches
They exist in the hoggam and fly out to kill warbs.

>t entryway
It's the entryway of a morleon.

>t path
You'll have to move at it before you can examine it.

>t samilen
You'll have to move at it before you can examine it.
A group of gitches moves at the hoggam.

>t exit
Which do you mean, the west exit, the east exit, the north exit, the south exit,
the northwest exit, the southwest exit, the northeast exit or the southeast exit?

>north
You detect nothing useful about the north exit.
A warb exits the ground.

>t glauds
Which do you mean, the hold-able glaud, the alive glaud, the glaud-with-
lock-er, the glaud of jenth or the Cobbic glaud?

>t hold-able
A hold-able glaud is about as useless as a darf of jenth, but at least it can
protect the doshery from the gitches.
A gitch flies from the hoggam to kill and eat the warb.

>t alive
It's weak, but it's still alive.

>t lock-er
You can't detect the hold-age, since the glaud-with-lock-er is close'd.
A warb exits the ground.

>t jenth
The largest of the glauds, it exists near the north exit: six nayfes of jenth, all
bad and hard.
A gitch flies from the hoggam to kill and eat the warb.

>t cobbic
A glaud with folls of the Cobbics is a awful thing. This one is strong-ly stick'd,
with a shell of poskot.
A gitch examines you from the hoggam.

>t shell
A glaud with folls of the Cobbics is a awful thing. This one is strong-ly stick'd,
with a shell of poskot.

>open lock-er
It seems to be lock'd.

>unlock lock-er
(with the shamtag)
That doesn't seem to match the lock-er.

>use shamtag
The shamtag sounds!
The group of gitches are frighten'd by the sound-ing and move exist.
A group of gitches moves at the hoggam.

>t shamtag
It's a good and sharmy shamtag that sounds when you use it. Its top is
close'd. The shamtag is currently set'd positive.

>set negative
What do you want to set negative?

>shamtag
It opens itself, reveal-ing a pogrifon.
A gitch examines you from the hoggam.

>x pogrifon
That's not a verb I recognise.

>t pogrifon
It's a fancy pogrifon of sindish and koldgeon, create'd as a juffet for your
shamtag.
A warb exits the ground.

>brighten self
Brighten'd.
A gitch flies from the hoggam to kill and eat the warb.

>j
Are you sure you want to move at the darken'd entryway? yes

Morleon
This is the morleon where the drokes contail - or did, until it was darken'd.
The canopy and the exits are all of paided sindish. A fostin is in the northeast
exit.
A duscat shudders west and east across the ground.

>t duscat
It's hardly large, but it could attack you still. It's beckling west and east and
whine-ing.
>whine
You whine. The duscat whines more podly for a minute:
"duh kuh too... duh toh ker... ka te..."
Is there use or purpose in that?
The duscat whines.

>t fostin
You'll have to move at it before you can examine it.

>move at fostin

Fostin of the Morleon
The fostin is far too fancy for the morleon, but then, that's why it's a
fostin. You can detect the morleon from here.

You can detect here a unlock-er and a sign.

>t unlock-er
You detect nothing useful about the unlock-er.

>hold unlock-er
Hold'd.

>t sign
There's a message on the sign: "No Charge-ing".

>charge sign
You charge it until it's fully-charged, but it discharges.

>hold sign
Hold'd.

>r

Fostin of the Morleon
The fostin is far too fancy for the morleon, but then, that's why it's a
fostin. You can detect the morleon from here.

>k
You can't move at that exit.

>kh

Morleon
This is the morleon where the drokes contail - or did, until it was darken'd.
The canopy and the exits are all of paided sindish. A fostin is in the northeast
exit.
A duscat shudders west and east across the ground.

>use shamtag
Since it's set'd negative, it doesn't sound.

>close shamtag
You close the shamtag.

>set shamtag positive
You set the shamtag positive.

>use shamtag
The shamtag sounds!
The duscat shudders and moves exist.

>k

Delcot
This is the delcot of tondam, where gitches fly and duscats attack. Across from
a darken'd entryway, a path exists to northwest and west, enter-ing a samilen to its
south.

Stick'd in the north exit are five glauds.

>j
Are you sure you want to move at the darken'd entryway? yes
Please answer yes or no.> no
Ok, you don't move there.
A warb exits the ground.

>hold warb
Hold'd.

>t warb
A lurpid warb of the ground.

>drop warb
It enters the ground.

>hold gitch
You hold one.

>t gitch
(the gitch)
Hold-ing it, you can detect its deeks. They're loddled, so it's a loddle-deeked
gitch. The rest of the group will be loddle-deeked too.
A loddle-deeked gitch examines you from the hoggam.

>drop gitch
(the gitch)
Drop'd, it flies away.
A group of loddle-deeked gitches moves at the hoggam.

>kl

Path
You're on a path exist-ing south, with gropples on the canopy. There's a barrier
across the path here, and the delcot is to east.
A pilter exists here, examine-ing the canopy for gropples to eat.

>t pilter
A massive animal with powerful tooths, examine-ing the northeast exit.

>t canopy
You detect nothing useful about the canopy.
The pilter moves at the south exit.

>t gropples
The path is cover'd with them.

>t barrier
The barrier exists across the path.

>use barrier
You use it. Nothing useful results.

>close barrier
You close it for a minute, but it just opens itself again. It must be bad.

>h

Path
You're on a path exist-ing north and west, with gropples on the canopy.
A pilter exists here, examine-ing the canopy for gropples to eat.

>k

Path
You're on a path exist-ing south and east, with gropples on the canopy. There's a
barrier across the path here.

>h

Path
You're on a path exist-ing north, with gropples on the canopy. To south is the
samilen you detect'd from the delcot.

>h
As you enter the samilen, a droke detects you. "A gostak!" he speaks. "Here to
brighten the doshes? You can't. A gamda create'd a gheliper in the delcot, and the
gheliper's been drop-ing glauds at the doshery. And as for us drokes, well, ever
since the gamda, our morleon has been darken'd. But enter and speak! Maybe
you'll detect something useful."

Samilen
A samilen for the drokes of tondam. You can move at the delcot to northeast or the
path to north.
A droke is speak-ing at himself by the south exit.

You can also detect here a darf-creater.

>t darf-creater
It's a jeddy-paided darf-creater with three selectors. The brimny selector is set'd
negative, the clarby selector is set'd positive, and the statched selector is set'd negative.
Its receptacle holds a tarshen darf.

>eat tarshen
(first hold-ing the tarshen darf)
You eat a tarshen darf.

>set clarby negative
You set the clarby selector negative.

>use darf-creater
It creates a suddy darf and drops it into a receptacle.

>t suddy
It's not eat-able by gostaks, but you could drop it at a pank if you detect one.

>eat suddy
(first hold-ing the suddy darf)
Ignore-ing the droke's speak, you eat a suddy darf. But suddy darfs are only
for pilters and panks, not dunmile gostaks. Within a minute, you dissolve into the
ground.


*** You have been kill'd ***



In that game, there were are five glauds stick'd in the north exit of the
delcot.

>speak at droke about suddy
"Don't eat those. They're for animals only."

>hold suddy
Hold'd.

>speak at droke about glauds
(the glauds)
"There's five glauds. Unless the gheliper create'd more."

>speak at droke about glaud
Which do you mean, the hold-able glaud, the alive glaud, the glaud-with-
lock-er, the glaud of jenth or the Cobbic glaud?

>hold-able
"Hardly a glaud at all. Unless you're a duscat or a animal or something and can't
hold things."

>speak at droke about animal
"We're always detect-ing pilters on the path. They're almost as massive as panks,
but you can't create gropples without pilters."

>speak at droke about duscat
(the duscat)
"So that's what's been attack-ing drokes in the morleon. It must have been frighten'd
from the delcot by the gheliper."

>speak at droke about duscats
"I can't speak anything at you about those."

>speak at droke about pilters
"We're always detect-ing pilters on the path. They're almost as massive as panks,
but you can't create gropples without pilters."

>speak at droke about pank
"Powerful tooths, those panks hold. They can bite sindish or peel the shell
off a lonn."

>speak at droke about lonn
"You won't detect any lonns in the delcot of tondam. The Cobbics hold them all."

>speak at droke about sindish
(sindish)
"The exits of the morleon are of sindish."

>speak at droke about exit
Which do you mean, the west exit, the east exit, the north exit, the south exit,
the northwest exit, the southwest exit, the northeast exit or the southeast exit?

>southeast
"I can't speak anything at you about that."

>speak at droke about shell
(the shells in general)
"The Cobbics are fond of shells. That's why there are shells on some of the
darfs here."

>speak at droke about darfs
You haven't detect'd or been speak'd about any such thing.

>speak at droke about darf
Which do you mean, the suddy darf, the tarshen darf or the darf of jenth?

(the darf of jenth)
"Darfs of jenth are awful!" speaks the droke. "It's a wainted falliger.
Awful. Always the darfs of jenth."

>speak at droke about jenth glaud
"Ah, jenth. It can't be use'd, or kill'd, or open'd. But I once detect'd a pank
in a sitch of jenth. The pank bite'd the jenth with its tooths, and it just
drop'd from where it was stick'd."

>speak at droke about tooths
(the tooths)
"Most animals hold tooths, but few hold ones powerful enough to bite sindish or
jenth."

>speak at droke about gheliper
"She was the largest gheliper I've ever detect'd, and bad, too. She just enter'd
the delcot, drop'd those glauds at the doshery, and move'd away."

>speak at droke about shamtag
"Don't use that thing in the samilen."

>speak at droke about pogrifon
"That's weak for a gostak's shamtag, isn't it? They must be fond of you at the
bewl."

>speak at droke about warb
"That's for the gitches. Ever examine'd the dorl? Gitches don't exist there. No
warbs, that's why."

>speak at droke about gitches
"We're near of gitches here. The delcot is cover'd with them. Hence the
hoggam."

>speak at droke about hoggam
"I can't speak anything at you about that."

>speak at droke about deeks
"She was the largest gheliper I've ever detect'd, and bad, too. She just enter'd
the delcot, drop'd those glauds at the doshery, and move'd away."

>speak at droke about loddle-deeked
"We're near of gitches here. The delcot is cover'd with them. Hence the
hoggam."

>speak at droke about lock-er
"One of the other drokes drop'd a unlock-er in the fostin, but we can't enter there
now. The whole morleon was darken'd by the gamda that create'd the gheliper.

"But you're a gostak. Darken-age is nothing to you, eh?"

>speak at droke about unlock-er
"So, you hold'd it. Could you give it at me after you've unlock'd the
lock-er?"

>speak at droke about purpose
"I'm a droke; my purpose is speak-ing. But you're a gostak. Your purpose is darken-age
and brighten-ing. Brighten-ing the doshes."

>speak at droke about bewl
"That's where you gostaks move from, isn't it?"

>speak at droke about morleon
(the Morleon)
"It's darken'd, and everyone who's move'd at it has been attack'd."

>speak at droke about samilen
"I've been in the samilen ever since the morleon was darken'd."

>speak at droke about gamda
"It could reenter. It could even create another gheliper. After all, there are no
lonns here."

>speak at droke about cobbics
"The Cobbics exist in the dorl and create the panks."

>speak at droke about sitch
You haven't detect'd or been speak'd about any such thing.

>speak at droke about gropples
"I'm fond of the gropples on the path, but pilters are always eat-ing them."

>speak at droke about path
(the path)
"It's a jurmy exist, but not as jurmy as the morleon."

>speak at droke about canopy
"I can't speak anything at you about that."

>speak at droke about doshery
"It's north of the delcot, but the gheliper create'd some glauds, and they're
protect-ing it. I can't speak why."

>speak at droke about barrier
"Before we create'd that barrier, the pilters would enter the delcot sometimes."

>speak at droke about sign
"A sign? A sign? Oh, the 'No Charge-ing' sign from the fostin. Not useful. You
can charge. Not there's anything very charge-able left."

>sound
You sound weak-ly.
The droke examines you upset.

>whine
You whine.

>speak at droke about alive
"That which is alive can be kill'd. Among other things."

>speak at droke about cobbic
(the Cobbics)
"The Cobbics exist in the dorl and create the panks."

>speak at droke about glaud
Which do you mean, the hold-able glaud, the alive glaud, the glaud-with-
lock-er, the glaud of jenth or the Cobbic glaud?

>no
To speak at someone, try "someone, ignore me" or some such.

>droke, ignore me
"No, I'll just exist here in case one of the other drokes reenters."

>speak at droke about brimny
"That's for koldgeon."

>speak at droke about clarby
"That's to create the darfs nice. I always set that one positive for a nice tarshen
darf, but if one of the other selectors is set'd, it creates it with a shell."

>speak at droke about statched
"That's for shebtak."

>speak at droke about koldgeon
(koldgeon)
"There's koldgeon in some of the darfs. Try set-ing the brimny selector positive
before you use the create-er."

>speak at droke about shebtak
"There's shebtak in some of the darfs. Try set-ing the statched selector positive
before you use the create-er."

>set brimny positive
You set the brimny selector positive.

As you enter the doshery, you detect a massive smell. But not the nice smell of
the doshes.

It is the smell of a gheliper.

So that's the purpose of the glauds! The gheliper is exist-ing in the doshery itself
- exist-ing near the doshes, even.

"Gostak," she speaks. "So you've move'd through my glauds. But you can't move
through me. And I'll kill you before you do anything to my doshes."

Doshery
The doshery! Shinkod to all gostaks, and purpose of the bewl. But it's far more
massive than the bewl, and enters to the brenze. And of course, it's cover'd with
doshes throughout.
A gheliper exists near the doshes, protect-ing them.
The gheliper detects your shamtag and shudders strong-ly!

>t gheliper

The gheliper exists near the doshes, protect-ing them, her renzes good, unkillable.

>t doshes
They're all upset and wass to be brighten'd, but the gheliper is protect-ing them.
They're also examine-ing you.

>brighten doshes
Since the gheliper is protect-ing them, the gheliper is brighten'd instead. The
gheliper laughs strong-ly. "I speak'd that I'd kill you if you did that."


*** You have been kill'd ***



In that game, there were are no glauds stick'd in the north exit of the
delcot, and the doshes were not brighten'd.

"Back again, weak gostak? I'm still here, and the doshes are still mine."

Doshery
The doshery! Shinkod to all gostaks, and purpose of the bewl. But it's far more
massive than the bewl, and enters to the brenze. And of course, it's cover'd with
doshes throughout.
A gheliper exists near the doshes, protect-ing them.

>use shamtag
The shamtag sounds strong-ly, with tones of the gheliper!
The gheliper is frighten'd by her own tones! She protects her eyes.

>kill gheliper
The gheliper just ignores your weak kill-age.

>brighten doshes
You brighten the doshes.

The gheliper detects the brighten'd doshes, and is dunmile. "My doshes! All my
martle doshes!" She examines you, and protects the south exit. "You! Everything was so
nice, so tunsel, until you move'd from the bewl, unstick-ing my glauds, attack-ing
the darken-age, brighten-ing my... brighten-ing my..."

She shudders. "You... you gostak!" It is the best thing she could speak. She
could kill you now...

But with the doshes brighten'd, her misdeave is skent, and instead, she just
sounds stottily and flies away.

You move at south. It's quiet in the delcot - even the gitches are quiet. But the
gheliper's fly-ing could be detect'd from the dorl, and maybe even the bewl. The
drokes must have detect'd it. Soon they will reenter, and all will be nice here
again.

Of course, the gheliper could always reenter. The gamda, even, could reenter. But
for now, the doshes are brighten'd. And that's enough for a gostak.
