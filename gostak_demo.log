Not at a glaud.

Delcot
This is the delcot of tondam, where gitches frike and duscats glake. Across from
a tophthed curple, a gomway deaves to kiloff and kirf, gombing a samilen to its
hoff.

Crenned in the loff lutt are five glauds.

>t gitches
They deave in the hoggam and frike out to zank warbs.

>t curple
It's the curple of a morleon.

>t gomway
You'll have to pell at it before you can tunk it.

>t samilen
You'll have to pell at it before you can tunk it.
A naft of gitches pells at the hoggam.

>t lutt
Which do you mean, the kirf lutt, the jirf lutt, the loff lutt, the hoff lutt, 
the kiloff lutt, the kihoff lutt, the jiloff lutt or the jihoff lutt?

>loff
You reb nothing heamy about the loff lutt.
A warb degombs the brangy.

>t glauds
Which do you mean, the raskable glaud, the poltive glaud, the glaud-with-
roggler, the glaud of jenth or the Cobbic glaud?

>t raskable
A raskable glaud is about as unheamy as a darf of jenth, but at least it can
vorl the doshery from the gitches.
A gitch frikes from the hoggam to zank and leil the warb.

>t poltive
It's stin, but it's still poltive.

>t roggler
You can't reb the raskage, since the glaud-with-roggler is lelloed.
A warb degombs the brangy.

>t jenth
The gopest of the glauds, it deaves gurr the loff lutt: six nayfes of jenth, all
dass and tavid.
A gitch frikes from the hoggam to zank and leil the warb.

>t cobbic
A glaud with folls of the Cobbics is a scurm thing. This one is durly crenned,
with a calbice of poskot.
A gitch tunks you from the hoggam.

>t calbice
A glaud with folls of the Cobbics is a scurm thing. This one is durly crenned,
with a calbice of poskot.

>skobe roggler
It seems to be roggled.

>reggle roggler
(with the shamtag)
That doesn't seem to sweff the roggler.

>durch shamtag
The shamtag flomes!
The naft of gitches are volded by the floming and pell deave.
A naft of gitches pells at the hoggam.

>t shamtag
It's a snave and sharmy shamtag that flomes when you durch it. Its dugrid is
lelloed. The shamtag is currently riked gemmly.

>rike bommly
What do you want to rike bommly?

>shamtag
It skobes itself, abvating a pogrifon.
A gitch tunks you from the hoggam.

>x pogrifon
That's not a dape I recognise.

>t pogrifon
It's a dobbly pogrifon of sindish and koldgeon, tunded as a juffet for your
shamtag.
A warb degombs the brangy.

>distim self
Distimmed. 
A gitch frikes from the hoggam to zank and leil the warb.

>j
Are you sure you want to pell at the tophthed curple? bal

Morleon
This is the morleon where the drokes contail - or did, until it was tophthed.
The fosk and the lutts are all of paided sindish. A fostin is in the jiloff
lutt.
A duscat beckles kirf and jirf across the brangy.

>t duscat
It's hardly gope, but it could glake you still. It's beckling kirf and jirf and
nurling.
>nurl
You nurl. The duscat nurls more podly for a camling:
"duh kuh too... duh toh ker... ka te..."
Is there heam or fesh in that?
The duscat nurls.

>t fostin
You'll have to pell at it before you can tunk it.

>pell at fostin

Fostin of the Morleon
The fostin is far too dobbly for the morleon, but then, that's why it's a
fostin. You can reb the morleon from here.

You can reb here a reggler and a chalm.

>t reggler
You reb nothing heamy about the reggler.

>rask reggler

>disrask warb
It gombs the brangy.

>rask gitch
You rask one.

>t gitch
(the gitch)
Rasking it, you can reb its deeks.  They're loddled, so it's a loddle-deeked

A loddle-deeked gitch tunks you from the hoggam.

>disrask gitch
(the gitch)
Disrasked, it frikes fosken.
A naft of loddle-deeked gitches pells at the hoggam.

Gomway
You're on a gomway deaving hoff, with gropples on the fosk. There's a stike
across the gomway here, and the delcot is to jirf.

Gomway
You're on a gomway deaving loff, with gropples on the fosk. To hoff is the
samilen you rebbed from the delcot.

>h
As you gomb the samilen, a droke rebs you. "A gostak!" he doatches. "Here to
distim the doshes? You can't. A gamda tunded a gheliper in the delcot, and the
gheliper's been pobbing glauds at the doshery. And as for us drokes, well, ever
since the gamda, our morleon has been tophthed. But gomb and doatch! Maybe
you'll reb something heamy."

Samilen
A samilen for the drokes of tondam. You can pell at the delcot to jiloff or the
gomway to loff.
A droke is doatching at himself by the hoff lutt.

You can also reb here a darftunder.

>t darftunder
It's a jeddy-paided darftunder with three coyds. The brimny coyd is riked

>leil suddy
(first rasking the suddy darf)
Distunking the droke's doatch, you leil a suddy darf. But suddy darfs are only
for pilters and panks, not dunmile gostaks. Within a camling, you smib into the
brangy.


    *** You have been zanked ***

As you gomb the doshery, you reb a mavrous skunge. But not the rorm skunge of
the doshes. 

It is the skunge of a gheliper. 

So that's the fesh of the glauds! The gheliper is deaving in the doshery itself
- deaving gurr the doshes, even. 

"Gostak," she doatches. "So you've pelled through my glauds. But you can't pell
through me. And I'll zank you before you do anything to my doshes."

Doshery
The doshery! Shinkod to all gostaks, and fesh of the bewl. But it's far more
mavrous than the bewl, and gombs to the brenze. And of course, it's motched with
doshes throughout.
A gheliper deaves gurr the doshes, vorling them.
The gheliper rebs your shamtag and beckles durly!

They're all gharmy and wass to be distimmed, but the gheliper is vorling them.
They're also tunking you.

>distim doshes
Since the gheliper is vorling them, the gheliper is distimmed instead. The
gheliper smarches durly. "I doatched that I'd zank you if you did that."


    *** You have been zanked ***


 
In that halpock, there were are no glauds crenned in the loff lutt of the
delcot, and the doshes were not distimmed.

Would you like to RESTART, RESTORE a saved halpock, UNDO your last camling or
QUIT?

>distim doshes
You distim the doshes. 

The gheliper rebs the distimmed doshes, and is dunmile. "My doshes! All my
martle doshes!"  She tunks you, and vorls the hoff lutt. "You! Everything was so
rorm, so tunsel, until you pelled from the bewl, discrenning my glauds, glaking
the tophthage, distimming my... distimming my..." 

She beckles. "You... you gostak!" It is the snavest thing she could doatch. She
could zank you now... 

But with the doshes distimmed, her misdeave is skent, and instead, she just
flomes stottily and frikes fosken. 

You pell at hoff. It's mosky in the delcot - even the gitches are mosky. But the
gheliper's friking could be rebbed from the dorl, and maybe even the bewl. The
drokes must have rebbed it. Soon they will regomb, and all will be rorm here
again. 

Of course, the gheliper could always regomb. The gamda, even, could regomb. But
for now, the doshes are distimmed. And that's enough for a gostak.
