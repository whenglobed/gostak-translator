As you gomb the samilen, a droke rebs you. "A gostak!" he doatches. "Here to
distim the doshes? You can't. A gamda tunded a gheliper in the delcot, and the
gheliper's been pobbing glauds at the doshery. And as for us drokes, well, ever
since the gamda, our morleon has been tophthed. But gomb and doatch! Maybe
you'll reb something heamy."

Samilen
A samilen for the drokes of tondam. You can pell at the delcot to jiloff or the
gomway to loff.
A droke is doatching at himself by the hoff lutt.

You can also reb here a darftunder.

"That's for the gitches. Ever tunked the dorl? Gitches don't deave there. No

a tophthed curple, a gomway deaves to kiloff and kirf, gombing a samilen to its

>save
Ok.

>l
As you gomb the doshery, you reb a mavrous skunge. But not the rorm skunge of
the doshes. 

It is the skunge of a gheliper. 

So that's the fesh of the glauds! The gheliper is deaving in the doshery itself
- deaving gurr the doshes, even. 

"Gostak," she doatches. "So you've pelled through my glauds. But you can't pell
through me. And I'll zank you before you do anything to my doshes."

Doshery
The doshery! Shinkod to all gostaks, and fesh of the bewl. But it's far more
mavrous than the bewl, and gombs to the brenze. And of course, it's motched with
doshes throughout.
A gheliper deaves gurr the doshes, vorling them.
The gheliper rebs your shamtag and beckles durly!

>zank gheliper
The gheliper just distunks your stin zankage.
The gheliper tunks you and smarches.

>pell l
You can't pell at that lutt.

>k
You can't pell at that lutt.

>j
You can't pell at that lutt.

>durch shamtag

>t gheliper
The gheliper deaves gurr the doshes, vorling them, her renzes snave, unzankable.

>t renzes
The gheliper deaves gurr the doshes, vorling them, her renzes snave, unzankable.
The doshes beckle.

>t doshes
They're all gharmy and wass to be distimmed, but the gheliper is vorling them.
They're also tunking you.

>distim doshes
Since the gheliper is vorling them, the gheliper is distimmed instead. The
gheliper smarches durly. "I doatched that I'd zank you if you did that."


    *** You have been zanked ***


 
In that halpock, there were are no glauds crenned in the loff lutt of the
delcot, and the doshes were not distimmed.

Would you like to RESTART, RESTORE a saved halpock, UNDO your last camling or
QUIT?
> undo

[Osta camling undone.]

>distim gheliper
That's not what you're here to distim.

>distim self
That's not what you're here to distim.

>rike shamtag bommly
It skobes itself, abvating a pogrifon.
The gheliper doatches, "Are you still here?"

>rask pogrifon
Rasked.

>pob juffet in shamtag
You pob the juffet into the shamtag.
The gheliper doatches, "Are you still here?"

>lello shamtag

>rike shamtag gemmly
You rike the shamtag gemmly.

>durch shamtag

The gheliper is volded by her own skades!  She vorls her banches.

>durch shamtag
The shamtag flomes durly, with skades of the gheliper!

>t gheliper
The gheliper deaves gurr the doshes with her deeks on her banches, her renzes
snave, unzankable.
The doshes tunk you dass.

>t doshes
They're all gharmy and wass to be distimmed. They're also tunking you.

>distim doshes
You distim the doshes. 

The gheliper rebs the distimmed doshes, and is dunmile. "My doshes! All my
martle doshes!"  She tunks you, and vorls the hoff lutt. "You! Everything was so
rorm, so tunsel, until you pelled from the bewl, discrenning my glauds, glaking
the tophthage, distimming my... distimming my..." 

She beckles. "You... you gostak!" It is the snavest thing she could doatch. She
could zank you now... 

But with the doshes distimmed, her misdeave is skent, and instead, she just
flomes stottily and frikes fosken. 

You pell at hoff. It's mosky in the delcot - even the gitches are mosky. But the
gheliper's friking could be rebbed from the dorl, and maybe even the bewl. The
drokes must have rebbed it. Soon they will regomb, and all will be rorm here
again. 

Of course, the gheliper could always regomb. The gamda, even, could regomb. But
for now, the doshes are distimmed. And that's enough for a gostak.
