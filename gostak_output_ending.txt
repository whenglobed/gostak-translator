Ok.

As you enter the doshery, you detect a mavrous smell. But not the nice smell of
the doshes.

It is the smell of a gheliper.

So that's the purpose of the glauds! The gheliper is exist-ing in the doshery itself
- exist-ing near the doshes, even.

"Gostak," she speaks. "So you've move'd through my glauds. But you can't move
through me. And I'll kill you before you do anything to my doshes."

Doshery
The doshery! Shinkod to all gostaks, and purpose of the bewl. But it's far more
mavrous than the bewl, and enters to the brenze. And of course, it's cover'd with
doshes throughout.
A gheliper exists near the doshes, protect-ing them.
The gheliper detects your shamtag and shudders strong-ly!

Delcot
This is the delcot of tondam, where gitches fly and duscats attack. Across from
a darken'd entryway, a path exists to northwest and west, enter-ing a samilen to its
south.
A pilter exists here, examine-ing the canopy for gropples to eat.

>kh

Samilen
A samilen for the drokes of tondam. You can move at the delcot to northeast or the
path to north.
A droke is speak-ing at himself by the south exit.

You can also detect here a darf-creater.

>speak at droke about gheliper
"She was the largest gheliper I've ever detect'd, and broken, too. She just enter'd
the delcot, drop'd those glauds at the doshery, and move'd away."

>kl
You can't move at that exit.

Delcot
This is the delcot of tondam, where gitches fly and duscats attack. Across from
a darken'd entryway, a path exists to northwest and west, enter-ing a samilen to its

"Back again, weak gostak? I'm still here, and the doshes are still mine."

Doshery
The doshery! Shinkod to all gostaks, and purpose of the bewl. But it's far more
mavrous than the bewl, and enters to the brenze. And of course, it's cover'd with
doshes throughout.
A gheliper exists near the doshes, protect-ing them.
The doshes shudder.

>create doshes
You're just a gostak. Create-ing without a create-er is beyond you.
The gheliper detects your juffet and shudders strong-ly!

>examine doshes
They're all upset and wass to be brighten'd, but the gheliper is protect-ing them.
They're also examine-ing you.

>examine gheliper
The gheliper exists near the doshes, protect-ing them, her renzes good, unkillable.

>kill gheliper
The gheliper just ignores your weak kill-age.

>brighten doshes
Since the gheliper is protect-ing them, the gheliper is brighten'd instead. The
gheliper laughs strong-ly. "I speak'd that I'd kill you if you did that."


*** You have been kill'd ***



In that game, there were are no glauds stick'd in the north exit of the
delcot, and the doshes were not brighten'd.

>use shamtag
The shamtag sounds!
The gheliper laughs. "No tones? Some gostak you are."

>m
You are take-ing:
a juffet
a chalm
a unlock-er
your shamtag (which is close'd)

>take shamtag brimmly
I only understood you as far as wanting to take the shamtag.

>take shamtag bommly
I only understood you as far as wanting to take the shamtag.

>set shamtag bommly
It opens itself, reveal-ing a pogrifon.

>take pogrifon
Take'd.

>drop pogrifon at gheliper
The gheliper just ignores your weak kill-age.

>use juffet
You use it. Nothing useful results.

>drop juffet at shamtag
Purposes.
The doshes shudder.

>close shamtag
You close the shamtag.

>set shamtag gemmly
You set it gemmly, but it's empty, so it sets itself bommly again.

>open shamtag
You open the shamtag.

>drop juffet in shamtag
You drop the juffet into the shamtag.

>set shamtag gemmly
You can't set it gemmly while it's open'd.
The gheliper uses a dosh. It shudders.

>use shamtag
Since it's set'd bommly, it doesn't sound.
The doshes shudder.

>close shamtag
You close the shamtag.

>set shamtag gemmly
You set the shamtag gemmly.

>use shamtag
The shamtag sounds strong-ly, with tones of the gheliper!
The gheliper is frighten'd by her own tones! She protects her eyes.
The doshes examine you broken.

>examine gheliper
The gheliper exists near the doshes with her deeks on her eyes, her renzes
good, unkillable.
The doshes move exist.

>examine doshes
They're all upset and wass to be brighten'd. They're also examine-ing you.

>brighten doshes
You brighten the doshes.

The gheliper detects the brighten'd doshes, and is dunmile. "My doshes! All my
martle doshes!" She examines you, and protects the south exit. "You! Everything was so
nice, so tunsel, until you move'd from the bewl, unstick-ing my glauds, attack-ing
the darken-age, brighten-ing my... brighten-ing my..."

She shudders. "You... you gostak!" It is the best thing she could speak. She
could kill you now...

But with the doshes brighten'd, her misdeave is skent, and instead, she just
sounds stottily and flies away.

You move at south. It's quiet in the delcot - even the gitches are quiet. But the
gheliper's fly-ing could be detect'd from the dorl, and maybe even the bewl. The
drokes must have detect'd it. Soon they will reenter, and all will be nice here
again.

Of course, the gheliper could always reenter. The gamda, even, could reenter. But
for now, the doshes are brighten'd. And that's enough for a gostak.
